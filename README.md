Assignment #3 - Authentication API: 
You are working with an amazing team that develops a super popular mobile game, the team decided to 
make the game only available to logged in users. 
Task: - 
Design an oAuth login API, the API shall tell the user his/her roles and what systems regions 
he/she can access. 
System example regions: 
1. Board game “b_game” (default for all logged in users) 
2. VIP Character modification “vip_chararacter_personalize” “For VIP users” 
System roles example: 
1. Player “player” 
2. Administrator “admin” - - - - 
Kindly develop this API in ASP.Net MVC or .Net Core MVC (select one) and show us how you 
would structure the JWT token. 
You need to have a working API (user data can be static), with username and password 
authentication. 
The JWT token must contain the roles and scope within the claims section. 
You can skip Database design, develop against static data.
